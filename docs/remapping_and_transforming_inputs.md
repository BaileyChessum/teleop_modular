# Remapping and transforming inputs


## Background

Teleop Modular adds a set of [remap parameters](./input_source_remapping.md) to every input source 
implementation. They allow us to:
- Rename inputs
- Create axes from buttons
- Create buttons from axes
- Transform input values in various ways, such as:
    - Inverting axes and buttons
    - Linearly mapping an input range of axis values to an output range
    - Clamping axes
    - Raising axes to a power

This guide is yet to be written. All the tools you need to figure out how to solve the given problem should be available 
in [this document](./input_source_remapping.md) if you want to give it a crack early.
